HotSwapBot is an automatic swap bot for the BSC _(Binance Smart Chain)_ going through the PancakeSwap's router and factory.

ðŸ’² This bot is made to buy a certain number of the token you want from the BNB. If the value of the token goes up, then the high value becomes the 
reference value. Now if the token value goes below the reference value _(5%, configurable)_ then the token is swap in WBNB.
